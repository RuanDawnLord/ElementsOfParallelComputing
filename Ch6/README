Implementations of selected algorithms and presentation slides from Chapter 6
Questions/bugs: aubanel@unb.ca

NOTES:

1. I have only included implementations of sequential Bellman-Ford and Dijkstraâ€™s 
algorithms, in the interest of leaving the parallel implementations for student projects. 
For more implementation details on the parallel algorithms, please refer to the original 
research papers cited in the text.

2. Dijkstra's algorithm requires an indexed min priority queue. My code uses a separate 
module for the priority queue (indexedMinPQ.h), which I have not included since I adapted 
it from the indexed max priority queue in Sedgewick's Algorithms in C, 3rd edition.
