Implementations of selected algorithms and presentation slides from Chapter 7
Questions/bugs: aubanel@unb.ca

NOTES:

1. I have only included implementations of the sequential Fast Sweeping and Fast Marching
algorithms, in the interest of leaving the parallel implementations for student projects. 
For more implementation details on the parallel algorithms, please refer to the original 
research papers cited in the text.

2. The Fast Marching algorithm requires an indexed min priority queue (the same as for 
Dijkstra's algorithm in Chapter 6, although here the weights are doubles). My code 
uses a separate module for the priority queue (indexedMinPQ.h), whose implementation I
have not included since I adapted it from the indexed max priority queue in Sedgewick's 
Algorithms in C, 3rd edition.
