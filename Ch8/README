Implementations of selected algorithms and presentation slides from Chapter 8
Questions/bugs: aubanel@unb.ca

NOTE:
I have only included implementations of the sequential QuickHull, MergeHull and 
Graham Scan algorithms, in the interest of leaving the parallel implementations 
for student projects. For more implementation details on the parallel algorithms, 
please refer to the original research papers cited in the text.

Slides for Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3.2	convexHull.pdf
